#' McMaster Modality Data Set.
#'
#' A dataset containing information about _students_, _staff_, and _faculty_ commuting to McMaster University.
#' Data were collected by means of a travel survey in the fall of 2010. Respondents were asked about their mode
#' of travel to McMaster University, in Hamilton, Canada. They were also asked about the modes available
#' to them. The data set also contains relevant attributes about the respondents. The format of the table is wide,
#' with each row representing an individual respondent. These variables were augmented with information from the
#' 2011 Census of Canada and land use information from local sources.
